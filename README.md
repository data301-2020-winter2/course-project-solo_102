# Group Solo 102 - Dog Adoption in Hungary
## Milestones

Milestone 1: I have created a dataframe from a selected and approved dataset. Below I describe the dataset itself and what I hope to accomplish with it.
## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With the Adoptable Dogs datset I hope to explore what the trends are in terms of what makes a dog adoptable. I am interested to know which factors contribute the most to a dog being adopted quickly, and why certain dogs end up being left at the shelter for longer periods of time. I believe these questions will translate well to a dashboard.

The key columns of interest include: age, gender, breed, size, neutered, date of arrival, date put up for adoption, and date adopted.
